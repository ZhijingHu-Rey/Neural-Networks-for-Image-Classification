# Neural-Networks-for-Image-Classification
AI Final Project on Deep learning @ Johns Hopkins Univ
- Implemented an image classification model based on CNN.
- Trained it on Cifar-10 dataset.
- Applied different optimizers, learning rate scheduling and try different architectures.
- Added random augmentations to our dataset.
- Participated in inclass kaggle competition and achieved 91.580% accuracy and winned the 8th place out of 101 members on the leaderboard.
